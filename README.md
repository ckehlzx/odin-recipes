# odin-recipes
This is the first project that I'm going to be working on in The Odin Project Curriculum.

I created the index file (also known as the homepage).
From there, I created a new directory to house the recipes.
After creating the 3 separate recipe pages, I added images, unorganized and organized lists.

On the homepage, these pages are all linked.
